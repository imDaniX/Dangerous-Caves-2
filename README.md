### Major rewrite is planned to start in january 2022,

## Information
Adds more mechanics to caves in order to make caving a more interesting but challenging experience.

Plugin contains new custom dangerous monsters, caves aging, ins, new underground structures and more cool features.

More information later on Wiki page.

This project started as a fork of [Dangerous Caves](https://github.com/Evil-Lootlye/dangerous-caves), but it just gone too far, so I decided to detach/defork the original repository from the project.

Released under the MIT license.

## Build
Maven is required to compile the project.

So, just... you know... `mvn clean package`

## Download
If you can't compile plugin by yourself - just download it from [Actions](https://github.com/imDaniX/Dangerous-Caves-2/actions) tab (snapshots) or [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/76212/) resource page (releases).
