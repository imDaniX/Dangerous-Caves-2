# | Dangerous Caves by Evil-Lootlye
# | Recoded by imDaniX

# Version of this configuration file
version: ${cfg-version}

# NOTE: Chances
# All the chances are in percents

# NOTE: Formulas
# For formulas you can use all common operators + - * / ^ ( ), for square roots you can use operator #
# Also plugin will give you some variables to use in your expression
# So, "12^2 * (45.342+32.1) / #43.1" will result you approximately "1698.6" (which is right)

# NOTE: Worlds
# World names are case-sensitive
# Instead of specifying worlds you can leave them blank - all the OVERWORLD worlds are going to be used automatically

# NOTE: Ticks
# Plugin utilizes its own tick system which is based on vanilla one
# WORLD tick is 6300 vanilla ticks (about 5 minutes 15 seconds)
# PLAYER tick is 800 vanilla ticks (about 40 seconds)
# ENTITY tick is 4 vanilla ticks (about 200 milliseconds)

# NOTE: Values
# Materials(same as vanilla item ids; ignore LEGACY) https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
# Sounds https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html
