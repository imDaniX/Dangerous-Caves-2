# | Dangerous Caves by Evil-Lootlye
# | Recoded by imDaniX

# Version of this configuration file
version: ${config.version}

# NOTE: Chances
# All the chances are in percents

# NOTE: Formulas
# For formulas you can use all common operators + - * / ^ ( ).
# Some functions are also available, see https://github.com/imDaniX/EzMath/blob/master/src/main/java/me/imdanix/math/MathDictionary.java#L111
# Plugin will also give you some variables to work with in your expressions
# So, "12^2 * (45.342+32.1) / sqrt(43.1)" will result you approximately "1698.6" (which is right)

# NOTE: Worlds
# World names are case-sensitive
# Instead of specifying worlds you can leave them blank - all the OVERWORLD worlds are going to be used automatically

# NOTE: Ticks
# Plugin utilizes its own tick system which is based on vanilla one
# WORLD tick is 6300 vanilla ticks (about 5 minutes 15 seconds)
# PLAYER tick is 800 vanilla ticks (about 40 seconds)
# ENTITY tick is 4 vanilla ticks (about 200 milliseconds)

# NOTE: Values
# Materials(same as vanilla item ids; ignore LEGACY) https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
# Sounds(same as vanilla sounds, but . replaced with _) https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html

# Some plugin integrations

integration:

  # For disabling features in specific regions
  protection:
    # Available options: worldguard, worldguard-flags, griefprevention, griefprevention-flags, lands, lands-effectless, none
    # If you have several plugins, you can use multiple checks - just separate modes with comma
    # mode: worldguard-flags,griefprevention
    mode: none
    # `worldguard` will block any actions within regions. `worldguard-flags` requires flags to be set up
    # WorldGuard flags:
    # dc-entity-grief (magma monster, lava creeper)
    # dc-block-change (cave-ins, caves aging)
    # dc-player-effect (ambient sounds, hypoxia)

    # `griefprevention-flags` mode requires GriefPreventionFlags plugin. You don't need it for `griefprevention`
    # GriefPreventionFlags flags:
    # DCNoEntityGrief (magma monster, lava creeper)
    # DCNoBlockChange (cave-ins, caves aging)
    # DCNoPlayerEffect (ambient sounds, hypoxia)

    # Lands settings:
    # ENTITY_GRIEFING (magma monster, lava creeper)
